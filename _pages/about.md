My name is Moinuddin Shuvo, and I am a Mechanical Engineer by degree and profession. Feel free to reach out or connect with me!


Experiences
======  
* Mechanical Engineer (II)\
_Parker Hannifin Corp., Mentor, OH [10/2023-Current]_
   *  Plan and execute FEA tasks for state-of-the-art fuel nozzles for commercial and military gas turbine engines. 
   *  Performs static and transient heat transfer, structural, modal, dynamic and fracture mechanics analysis to assess product thermal performance, structural integrity and low and high cycle fatigue (LCF and HCF) capability. 
   *  Make recommendations for product improvements and participate as a high-level contributor in the design of products.
   *  Provide technical information for review with engineering teams using established engineering practices, standards, and documentation methods.
   *  Present analysis results in design reviews with internal and external customers.

* Mechanical Design Engineer.\
_Tesla Inc., Austin, TX [04/2023-08/2023]_
  * Collaborated with cross-functional teams to gather requirements (e.g., part, rate, schedule, cost, etc.) for new casting lines. Designed, performed FEA analysis (static, dynamic) worked with fabricators, and oversaw installation of equipment for recycling furnace, and holding furnace. Performed equipment repairs and rebuilds.
  * Designed custom fixtures, jigs, tools, etc. as needed, providing detailed build-to-print models/drawings for fabrication. Evaluated failures and provided technical solutions to improve quality and OEE in the specified area. 
  * Oversaw technical details and scheduled performance of equipment from suppliers. Commissioned and troubleshooted new equipment, ensuring performance requirements were met.

* Spring and Summer Co-Op\
_Ashland Foundry & Machine Works LLC, Ashland, PA [01/2022-07/2022]_
  * Participated as part of the MRB (Material Review Board) team and helping to develop improved and optimized gating systems as appropriate.
  * Worked with AFMW Foundry Engineering to develop gating systems for new projects.
  * Worked with Foundry Engineering and Foundry Operations to identify inefficient gating systems for improvement and optimizations
  * Supported 3D sand printing operations. 

* Graduate Research Assistant\
_The SHAPE Lab, Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA [09/2020 - Current]_
  * Designed a gating and riser system for a robot arm casting project. Applied casting design methodologies to improve the feeding system for the cast using Aluminum 319 alloy.
  * Co-ordinated a group of seven people from four different companies to successfully finish the project. Implemented an online communication platform to keep track of progress and for active communication.

* Graduate Research Assistant \
_W. M. Keck Center, The University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas [09/2018 - 05/2020]_
  * Designed & developed an experimental setup using Design of Experiments (DOE) with a multiâˆ’wavelength pyrometer, resistive coil heater, PID controllers, thermocouple insertion for accurate surface temperature measurements.
  * Performed OHN analyzer, particle size analyzer, and surface roughness tests. Prepared CAD designs of the sample

* Assistant Engineer\
_ACI Limited, Dhaka, Bangladesh [01/2018 - 06/2018]_
  * Designed training courses, organized training, prepared and updated three training manuals for the department.
  * Trained over 150 people about different agricultural machinery- Tractors, Power Tillers, Combined Harvester, etc.
  * Followed ISO 9001:2000 for maintaining Quality Management System (QMS).
